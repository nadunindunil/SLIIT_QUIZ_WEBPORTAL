# QuizApp web app

## A brief about project:

A hybrid mobile application using, which teachers can add quizzes(assignments)
and students can do quizzes. Answers for question types such as MCQs,
True-False and Short answer, are added when the quiz is added and
marking of the answers is automated for these type of quizzes and
students can see the results immediately.
Students and teachers can track the progress and see how the others
have performed.
These quizzes are added publicly so therefore students can access
quizzes added anywhere in the world. This enables the institutes and
students who does not have access to good teachers and quality assignments
to access to these knowledge.
